# Codility
An exercise repo in which I put only 100% solutions (all test cases for small, large, random, random small, random large, boundaries data are completed) of Codility lessons of proggraming. Most of them are written in Python3 but sometimes i compare Python with C++ language so that the complexity of syntax can be shown easily. Not 100% solutions are on separate branches for each problem because nobody's prefect ;).

Look up the site:
https://app.codility.com/programmers/
I found it enjoyable to discover these exercises.
